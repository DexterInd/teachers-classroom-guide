# Making a class set of SD cards

Once you have updated, upgraded and added any extra software to your own SD card image, you are able to make a copy of your master SD card and then use that to make a class set.

1. Place your master SD card in a desktop computer or laptop with an SD card reader.
1. On Windows use [Win disk 32 imager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) to make a copy of an SD card. On Mac OS X you can use the `dd` command or a [dd-gui](http://www.gingerbeardman.com/dd-gui/).
1. Remove the master SD card and keep it safe.
1. Take a fresh SD card and insert it into your computer or laptop.
1. Format the SD card then, using your imaging software, select the image and write it to the card.
1. Repeat the last step for the rest of your cards.
